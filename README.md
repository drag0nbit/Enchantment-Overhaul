# Enchantment Overhaul
I got bored with minecraft's original enchantment system, so I edited it, enjoy!
##
Currently, this mod adds:
- 0 enchantments:
- - no enchantments
- 0 items:
- - no items
- 0 blocks:
- - no blocks
##
This mod also edits:
- Nothing rn
##
Soon there will be:
- Reworked enchanting table which now need runes to do stuff
- New enchantments like vampirism or wind jump
- New curses that will ruin your weapon (or will it?)
- Slightly reworked Mending: now it is rare and can be only obtained in enchanting table
- Anvil repair/rename xp cost that never changes no matter of enchantments you put in it
- Edited villagers trades that have low enchantments now
- Particles to some enchantments like flame trail to arrows
- Fully configurable config that you can disable and enable whatever this mod edits
- Sync config between server and client, so you don't need to do it manually
